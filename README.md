## Overview
In the [RoboCup Small Size League (SSL)](https://ssl.robocup.org/), teams are encouraged to propose solutions for executing basic soccer tasks inside the SSL field using only embedded sensing information for the [Vision Blackout Challenge](https://ssl.robocup.org/robocup-2022-technical-challenges/). We propose an embedded monocular vision approach for detecting objects and estimating relative positions inside the soccer field.

### Proposed Approach
During soccer matches and especially for the Vision Blackout challenge, SSL objects mostly lay on the soccer field, and we exploit this prior knowledge for proposing a monocular vision solution for detecting and estimating their relative positions to the robot:
- Camera is fixed to the robot and its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are obtained using calibration and pose computation techniques from the Open Computer Vision Library (OpenCV);
- SSD MobileNet v2 is used for detecting objects' 2D bounding boxes on camera frames;
- Linear regression is applied to the bounding box’s coordinates, assigning a point on the field that corresponds to the object’s bottom center, which has its relative position to the camera, and, therefore, to the robot, estimated using pre-calibrated camera parameters;
- The system achieves real-time performance with an average processing speed of 30 frames per second and 10.8 Watts of power consumption. 

The following figure illustrates a scheme for the proposed method:

The Nano sends target positions and kicking commands to the robot's microncontroller through UDP socket, enabling it execute basic soccer tasks autonomously:

## Setup From Fresh Jetpack 4.6.1 Installation

### Remove Unnecessary Libraries (Optional)
```
sudo apt remove libreoffice*
sudo apt remove thunderbird
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt-get update
```

### Add Swap Memory (Optional)
Some applications require more than 4GB of memory to execute, so we recommend [creating a swap file](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/creating-a-swap-file/65385)

Execute following steps to add 4G of swap space:
```
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

```

`free -m` will show the swap file is on. Jetson Nano usually comes with 2GB of swap, so after adding 4GB it should be around 6GB.
You can also pull up the System Monitor, however this is only temporary. If you reboot, swap file is gone.

Add the line `/swapfile none swap 0 0` to `/etc/fstab` file. Now you can reboot and your Swap will be activated.

### Install Fan Controller (Optional)
If you have a PWM controlled fan, [Pyrestone fan controller](https://github.com/Pyrestone/jetson-fan-ctl.git) will automatically start the fan at boot time. 

Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt install python3-dev
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Clone Repo and run installation script:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pyrestone/jetson-fan-ctl.git
cd jetson-fan-ctl/
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Install VSCode (Optional)
VS Code can be download and installed directly from VS Code website.

More easily, [Jetson Hacks repo](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installVSCode.git) contains a script for acquiring the latest compatible version.

Clone Repo and run installation script:
```
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installVSCode.git
cd installVSCode/
sudo ./installVSCode.sh
```

### Add CUDA Directory
Jetpack images already comes with CUDA Toolkit installed, you may check under `/usr/local/cuda` to verify that it’s there, but its [bashrc script may not contain CUDA directory](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/cuda-nvcc-not-found/118068).

Check that your ~/.bashrc file has these lines at the end, and if not, add them and restart your terminal:
```
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64\
                       ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```

### TensorRT Setup
We generate TensorRT models from a ONNX file converted from TensorFlow Lite. However, [NonMaxSuppression operation is still in tests in TensorRT 8.2](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorrt/blob/8.2-GA/docs/operators.md), so it is not possible to run the detection model. TensorRT's batchedNMSPlugin and nmsPlugin are not compatible with TensorFlow Lite's TFLite_Detection_PostProcess. Therefore, create a plugin TFLiteNMS_TRT to run the TensorFlow Lite detection model.

Reference: [TensorRT (TensorFlow 1 TensorFlow Lite Detection Model)](https://github.com/NobuoTsukamoto/tensorrt-examples/blob/main/python/detection/README.md)

To build TensorRT with the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Jetson's pre-installed CMake is 3.10.2, but TensorRT requires 3.13 or higher, so install cmake it from snap:
```
sudo apt remove cmake
sudo snap install cmake --classic
sudo reboot
```

2. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/jgocm/ssl-detector.git
cd ssl-detector/
```

3. Build TensorRT:
```
export TRT_LIBPATH=`pwd`/TensorRT
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
cd $TRT_LIBPATH
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DTRT_LIB_DIR=$TRT_LIBPATH -DTRT_OUT_DIR=`pwd`/out -DTRT_PLATFORM_ID=aarch64 -DCUDA_VERSION=10.2 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc
make -j3
```

4. Copy the plugin from TensorRT folder and replace the existing one (for Jetpack 4.6.1 TensorRT version is 8.2.0):
```
sudo cp out/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8.2.0 /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8.2.0
sudo rm /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8.2.0 /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libnvinfer_plugin.so.8
```

5. Install [pycuda](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pycuda-installation-failure-on-jetson-nano/77152/22)
```
sudo pip3 install --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/cuda/include" --global-option="-L/usr/local/cuda/lib64" pycuda
```

6. Convert ONNX model to TRT:
```
cd /home/$USER/ssl-detector/src/
python3 convert_onnxgs2trt.py \
    --model ../models/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_300x300_ssl/onnx/model_gs.onnx \
    --output ../models/ssdlite_mobilenet_v2_300x300_fp16.trt \
    --fp16
```

### Testing SSL Detector
To test real-time object detection and localization run `object_localization.py` script from the root folder:
```
cd ssl-detector/
python3 src/object_localization.py
```

Bounding boxes and ball position are shown on screen based on RoboCIn SSL robot dimensions and Logitech C922 camera parameters. Next sections explain how to calibrate camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

### Camera Intrinsic Parameters Calibration
Follow the procedures from: [Camera Calibration using OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/camera-calibration-using-opencv/).

Pay attention to:
1. Any [checkerboard pattern](https://markhedleyjones.com/projects/calibration-checkerboard-collection) can be used, but the script has to be configured accordingly to the **number of inside vertices and distance between vertices**. If using the "A4 - 25mm squares - 7x10 vertices, 8x11 squares" pattern, for instance, dimensions will be:
```
# Defining the dimensions of checkerboard
CHECKERBOARD = (7,10)
criteria = (cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS + cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_MAX_ITER, 25, 0.001)
```

2. When capturing images of the checkerboard from different viewpoints (20 should be enough), **remember to configure the camera to the same resolution that will used for localization when capturing the images** (ours is 640x480).

### Camera Extrinsic Parameters Calibration
After intrinsic parameters calibration, the camera gets mounted onto the robot and we estimate its extrinsic parameters.

We place the robot at a known position for evaluating the results of the calibration, point it to the goal direction and run `camera_calibration.py`.

Even though **only 4 points are needed for calibrating the camera**, up to 10 reference points on the field can be marked on the screen:
```
reference_points = [
    'Field Left Corner',
    'Penalty Area Upper Left Corner',
    'Goal Bottom Left Corner',
    'Goal Bottom Center',
    'Goal Bottom Right Corner',
    'Penalty Area Upper Right Corner',
    'Field Right Corner',
    'Penalty Area Lower Left Corner',
    'Penalty Area Lower Right Corner',
    'Field Center'
]
```

Their global positions are estimated from the field dimensions on `configs/field_configs.py` and saved under [field_points3d.txt](https://github.com/jgocm/ssl-detector/blob/master/configs/field_points3d.txt).

At the calibration screen, the current reference point to be marked is shown on the upper left corner and the following mouse/keyboard commands are available:
- 'left mouse click': moves the marker to mouse cursor current position
- 'w/a/s/d' or arrow keys: move the marker 1 pixel from its current position
- 'space': places the marker on current position
- 'backspace': removes last marker
- 'enter': skips the current reference point
- 's': saves calibration parameters after all points are collected and prints camera translation (in mm) and rotation angles (in degrees) on terminal

The following image shows our currently used camera calibration procedure using 4 points only:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85940536/175784504-eb46bc5c-2b74-451a-97bb-a792cc973289.png)

Tips that improve accuracy:
1. Aligning the camera with the field axis helps a lot.
2. Marking points with precision impacts the calibration, so we recommend using points that are easier to identify: Field Corners, Goal Corners and Penalty Area Lower Corners
3. After saving, check if camera rotation and position results match with your setup. If not, try erasing points ('backspace') and redo calibration. Errors should be less than 10 mm for position and 1 degree for rotation angles.
